# FraudulantFirmDetectionInIndia
This project is based on the data in this article: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08839514.2018.1451032 
The goal is to build an algorithm that detects companies that are likely to commit fraud in India.

The total data has been separated into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). We will keep this proportion. The article does not specify how the data were separated. We will do it in a random way.

The researchers arrived at an accuracy of 0.94 and an AUC of 0.97. Our goal is to do as well or better.
